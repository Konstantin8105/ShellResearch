# Shell Research

Calculation research of shell with/without stiffiners by Calculix

DONE: 

	RC002 - Linear buckling for approve Timoshenko formula. Different finite element, precision
    RC003 - Linear buckling with different ratio(height/width) of finite elements 
	RC004 - Linear buckling for compare regular and unregular mesh

TODO:

  * Imperfections:

File research: Simulation_of_geometrical_imperfections_and_reliability_estimation_of_cylindrical_shell_structures

	Linear buckling mode-shaped imperfection (LBMI)
	Single perturbation load imperfection (SPLI)
	Geometrical dimple imperfection (GDI)
	Axisymmetric imperfections (ASI)
	Mid-surface imperfections (MSI)
 
  * Linear buckling of vertical plane plate with vertical stiffiners for approve approximation formula
  * Linear buckling with different amount vertical and horizontal stiffiners on axial force
  * Non-linear buckling with different amount vertical and horizontal stiffiners on axial force
  * Creating graph axial force (N) and moment (M) for specific model
  * Analyze with different types of imperfection
