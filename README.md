# Shell Research

Calculation research of shell with/without stiffiners by Calculix


TODO:

  * Linear buckling for approve Timoshenko formula
  		* Different finite element
		* Different height
		* Different diameter
		* Different presision
  * Linear buckling of vertical plane plate with vertical stiffiners for approve approximation formula
  * Calculation time for linear buckling on axial force & model precision
  * Shell without stiffiners: compare analytic formula and FE calculation
  * Compare result of fem calculation by depends finite element
  * Linear buckling with different amount vertical and horizontal stiffiners on axial force
  * Non-linear buckling with different amount vertical and horizontal stiffiners on axial force
  * Creating graph axial force (N) and moment (M) for specific model
  * Analyze with different types of imperfection
