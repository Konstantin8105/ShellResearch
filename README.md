# Shell Research

Calculation research of shell with/without stiffiners by Calculix

DONE: 

	RC002 - Linear buckling for approve Timoshenko formula. Different finite element, precision

TODO:
 
  * Linear buckling with different ratio(height/width) of finite elements 
  * Linear buckling of vertical plane plate with vertical stiffiners for approve approximation formula
  * Linear buckling with different amount vertical and horizontal stiffiners on axial force
  * Non-linear buckling with different amount vertical and horizontal stiffiners on axial force
  * Creating graph axial force (N) and moment (M) for specific model
  * Analyze with different types of imperfection
